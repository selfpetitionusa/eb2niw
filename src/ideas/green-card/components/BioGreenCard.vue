                      <p>A family from Europe, who moved to the US with an existing employer. Obtaining a green card was our #1 goal: unlocking the American dream.
                      <p><span style="font-weight: 600">From day-one, in our minds, "green card" -- meant "freedom":</span>

                              <li>to stay in US on our own terms,</li>
                              <li>to access job opportunities...</li>
                              <li>...and peace of mind: zero need to re-apply for a visa every couple of years (seeking employer sponsorship).</li>

                      <p>What followed, was a marathon of analyzing options (self-sponsored vs employer-sponsored) and finding a lawyer who would take our case. 30+ lawyers REJECTED us: "Your case does not meet our typical profile... etc.". In the end, we prepared all the documents and found the RIGHT lawyer to file"</p>
                      <p style="font-weight: 600">Our EAD arrived within 3 months. We changed employers based on EAD while green card application was pending.</p>
                      <p style="font-weight: 600">Finally, the green card decision arrived 9 months after filing.</p>
                      <p>Whether you decide to file yourself or with a lawyer -- you are welcome to use our experience, coming from happy Permanent Residents of USA, with business & tech background (NON-research).</p>
